# ReactBase
A base to start off developing a webpage in React using ES6 and Redux.  This provides the basic structures needed to have the developer experience that I personally prefer the most.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm start
```

## Hosting
To compile the `bundle.js` file used when the website is hosted simply run
```bash
npm run compile
```

To create the website on Github Pages, follow the instructions on https://pages.github.com/ and make sure the `gh-pages` branch contains `index.html` and a compiled `bundle.js`.
